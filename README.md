# guess_the_color
In this tiny project I used the Effect and State hooks to generate random colored box. I added 3 buttons with Hex color codes. In 1 button added a correct name of color of box, and in 2 others are random Hex color code. When you clicked on button - you have an answear saying if your choise correct or not.
